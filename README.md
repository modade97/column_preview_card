## My process
My process started with the implementation of HTML5 semantic markups in the HTML document, after that every other thing that followed was the CSS styling and design. The CSS styling and design stated with resetting, using the universal selector(*) to remove the natural margins and paddings that the HTML markup provides. Colors, margins, padding, fonts were then used to design the cards. Media Queries  was also used to design the desktop view.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This Challenge allowed me to practice more on CSS Flexbox, It also reminded me of the importance of using percentages(%) for your widths when building a responsive container for your website, landing pages, etc.
